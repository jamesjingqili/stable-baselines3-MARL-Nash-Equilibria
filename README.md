This repo builds upon stable-baselines 3, and we want to compute Nash equilibria in general-sum dynamic games, where we have coupled dynamics and potentially conflicting objectives among players. 

We will use OpenAI gym API, and we can easily modify the dynamics, individual rewards of each player, and the information structure because I found the user-customization modules of petting zoo and MPE environments are a bit challenging for me to understand, and they seem only support decoupled dynamics, which does not apply to a lot of cool application problems like shared autonomy and many classical game theory problems in Prof. Basar's [Dynamic non-cooperative games textbook](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611971132). I hope this repo can help game-theoretic RL researchers customize their dynamic game examples and improve the MARL algorithm design for real-world strategic decision-making applications. 

This repo is still under development, and we will try to get it done asap. Let me know if you want to collaborate, and any suggestions for the appealing features will be much appreciated!
