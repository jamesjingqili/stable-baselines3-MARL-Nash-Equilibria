This repo builds upon stable-baselines 3, and we want to compute Nash equilibria in general-sum dynamic games, where we have coupled dynamics and potentially conflicting objectives among players. We will prioritize the implementation of MADDPG, MATD3, MAPPO, and minimax DDPG. Future extension may also include MAPPO-Lagrangian and MADDPG-Lagrangian.

We will use OpenAI gym API, and we can easily modify the dynamics, individual rewards of each player, and the information structure. I hope this repo can help game-theoretic RL researchers customize their dynamic game examples and improve the MARL algorithm design for real-world strategic decision-making applications. 

This repo is still under development, and we will try to get it done in 2025 February. Let me know if you want to collaborate, or want to share any suggestions for the appealing features. Thank you.
